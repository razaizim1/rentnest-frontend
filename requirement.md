⚠️ Mandatory Requirements
Caution

MANDATORY - READ CAREFULLY

The following SIX requirements are MANDATORY:

API Integration & Documentation - Consume all required backend endpoints. Provide a brief API_INTEGRATION.md file mapping frontend components to backend endpoints.
Consistent UI Error Handling - All API errors must show user-friendly, structured UI feedback (e.g., Toast notifications, inline form errors, Error Boundaries).
Commits - 20 meaningful frontend commits with descriptive messages (e.g., feat: add role-based dashboard layout, fix: resolve stripe checkout redirect loop).
Admin Credentials - Provide working admin email & password to test the deployed frontend application.
Payment Integration - Must integrate the frontend flow for Stripe (Checkout/Elements) or SSLCommerz. Simulated/fake payments (Cash on Delivery, Pay Later) are NOT accepted. Must handle success/cancel redirect pages.
❌ Failure to complete any of these = 0 MARKS

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend
Technology	Purpose
Next.js (App Router)	React Framework, Routing, Server Components
TypeScript	Type safety (Mandatory)
Tailwind CSS	Styling (Shadcn UI, DaisyUI, or custom components allowed)
Fetch, TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR	Server state management and data fetching
Auth.js or Custom JWT Middleware	Authentication and protected routes
Stripe.js or SSLCommerz JS	Frontend payment gateway integration
Deployment
Service	Purpose
Vercel/Render	Frontend application deployment (Recommended)
🎯 Key Rules
Roles: Each project has 3 fixed roles. The UI must dynamically render navigation, dashboards, and actions based on the authenticated user's role. Use Next.js Middleware for route protection.
Payment: Payment integration is MANDATORY. The frontend must successfully initiate the payment (e.g., redirect to Stripe Checkout or SSLCommerz gateway) and handle the return URL (success/cancel pages) gracefully, updating the UI accordingly.
Backend Dependency: You may connect to your own backend from a previous assignment, a partner's backend, or a provided mock backend. If using a mock, document it clearly, but real API integration is highly preferred.
Performance: Optimize images using next/image, implement loading states (loading.tsx), and handle errors gracefully (error.tsx).
⚠️ Important Notes
Plagiarism = 0 Marks. All UI components, logic, and integrations must be your original work. Using AI to generate entire pages without understanding or customization will result in mark deduction.

Good luck! Build a blazing-fast, beautiful, and robust Next.js frontend you're proud of. 🚀



Assignment 5 - RentNest Frontend 🏠
"Find & List Rental Properties with Ease"

Project Overview
RentNest is a modern, responsive Next.js application for a rental property marketplace. Landlords can list properties, manage availability, and approve or reject rental requests via an intuitive dashboard. Tenants can browse listings with advanced filtering, submit rental requests, and complete secure payments. Admins oversee the entire platform through a comprehensive moderation dashboard.

💡 Note: This is a frontend-only assignment. You will consume a backend API (your own from a previous assignment).

⚠️ Note: Consider these requirements as a starting guide. Modify, add, or prune features to align with your implementation strategy.

Roles & Permissions
Role	Description	Frontend UI Expectations
Tenant	Users looking for rental properties	Public browsing, interactive request forms, payment checkout flow, review submission, protected tenant dashboard.
Landlord	Property owners who list rentals	Protected landlord dashboard, property CRUD forms (with image upload UI), request approval/rejection toggles, tenant history views.
Admin	Platform moderators	Protected admin dashboard, user management tables (ban/unban actions), global platform statistics, content moderation UI.
💡 Note: Users select their role during registration. The UI must dynamically adapt based on the authenticated user's role, and routes must be protected using Next.js Middleware.

Features & UI/UX Requirements
Public Features
Responsive Property Grid: Display properties with optimized images (next/image), price, location, and basic amenities.
Advanced Search & Filter: Sidebar or top-bar filters for location, price range, property type, and amenities with real-time UI updates.
Property Details Page: Comprehensive view with image gallery, description, landlord info, and a "Request to Rent" call-to-action (CTA).

Tenant Features
Auth Flows: Registration and login forms with validation error messages.
Rental Request Flow: Interactive form/modal to submit a request. If approved, a clear "Proceed to Payment" CTA.
Payment Integration: Seamless redirect to Stripe Checkout or SSLCommerz gateway. Dedicated /payment/success and /payment/cancel pages with clear UI feedback.
Tenant Dashboard: View rental request history (with status badges: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Active), payment history table, and a form to leave reviews after completion.
Landlord Features
Landlord Dashboard: Overview of total properties, active requests, and earnings.
Property Management: Forms to create, edit, and remove listings. Include UI for image URL uploads and availability toggles.

User Management: Data table of all users with search, pagination, and "Ban/Unban" action buttons.
Content Moderation: Views to inspect all listings and rental requests across the platform.
Frontend Routes & API Integration
⚠️ Note: These are suggested Next.js App Router paths. You must map these to your backend API endpoints.

Flow Diagrams & UI Considerations
🏠 Tenant Journey
[Register/Login] → [Browse Properties] → [View Details] 
       ↓
[Submit Request Form (Validation)] → [Wait for Approval UI]
       ↓
[Approved: "Pay Now" CTA] → [Stripe/SSLCommerz Redirect]
       ↓
[Payment Success Page] → [Leave Review Form]
UI Focus: Show loading spinners during form submission. Use toast notifications for success/failure.

🏘️ Landlord Journey
[Register/Login] → [Dashboard Overview] → [Create Listing Form]
       ↓
[View Incoming Requests Table] → [Click Approve/Reject]
       ↓
[Toast Notification: "Request Approved"] → [Tenant can now pay]
UI Focus: Use optimistic UI updates to instantly reflect status changes in the table without a full page reload.

📊 Rental Request Status (UI Badges)
PENDING → Yellow/Orange Badge
APPROVED → Blue Badge (Shows "Pay Now" button)
REJECTED → Red Badge
ACTIVE → Green Badge (Shows "Leave Review" button)
COMPLETED → Gray Badge
Good luck! Build a blazing-fast, accessible, and beautiful Next.js frontend you're proud of. 🚀
